This is a one page react app with an express backend.

Use it to create a list of ingredients for a recipe, converting to different units of measurements, and even convert it to measurements of weight, as opposed to measurements of volume (if it's found in the built-in JSON).

When you've made you're list, type in a name for it and press the save button. If the name isn't already taken, it will be pushed up to my server where you can load it any time you need it!

As a test, type in "chocolate chocolate chip cookies" and press load for my very own cookie recipe!
